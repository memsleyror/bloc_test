updates:

i tinkered around with css quite a bit to learn - see styles.css

bloghtml5.html is my new wireframe/template using html5 layout conventions

newstyles.css is what i built using a book i have on css and html5

i turned bloghtml5 into my sinatra app - one small issue with the css as noted in my email to you

reviewed bootstrap and love it - will use it for styles

still trying to get more comfortable with git - will review my workflow with you next week
